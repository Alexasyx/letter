    <p>Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
    <p> I know you're impatient but bear with me , sh*t this it not me hahaha  
        i hope this finds you well and happy , i don't wanna say it but you already know naman.  
        i honestly like everything i know about you so far , the impatient , your rants ,  
        well sometimes nakakatampo lang you left me unread then nasa ibang platform lang pala ahahaha ,  
        especially the random thing</p>
    <p>We may be limited in time sometimes .
        There's no need to rush things just take our time cause that is part of building trust and loyalty . 
        I always wish you the best thing to happen for you the moment you give the chance.  
        Sana makita mo and ako rin na what we have right now is special .
        And can't wait for you to speak more about what you love to do , 
        the things you hate and things that scare you . You're worthy of love , I know you have a past , 
        I can't fix that but I'll be here with you to figure things out.</p>
